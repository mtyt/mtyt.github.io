I'm not sure between this project and [optime], which was the chicken and which the egg.
Did I just need a guinea pig project to test my optimizer or did I make an optimizer for
this project?

Anyway, most probably I got a bit carried away after reading this article on Our World in Data:
[Environmental Impacts of Food Production][owid]. The article compares a number of food
products based on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, land use, water use, [eutrophication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication)
per kg but also per 100 g of protein, 100 g of fat and per 1000 kcal.

I thought it would be interesting to take this one step further and use this data to create
'recipes' that would target a certain nutritional value (in terms of kcal, grams of fat,
grams of protein) while  minimizing the environmental impact. This problem seemed perfect
for a genetic algorithm, et voila: [optime] was born (or, optime was laid and then I needed
something to try it out et voila, this project hatched)!

Turns out, neither chickens nor eggs in the most optimal recipe, but pain-au-chocolat and pumpkin seeds!
You may get different results because of the random events (something with gods and dice).

You can directly open and explore the Notebook in Google Colab here:

Or download it on GitHub [here][gh-nb]{:target="_blank"}.

Here's a graph of how the optimizer optimized the optimization goals:

And one of the top recipes:

[![Top recipe](/assets/img/recipe.png)](/assets/img/recipe.png)git statu

Which sounds delicious and has the following nutritional value and environmental impact:

    kg                      1.052732
    kcal                 2505.851226
    g protein              71.942087
    g fat                  97.814726
    Emissions               1.226780
    Land use                2.623058
    Eutrophication          7.946141
    Water withdrawals     230.737192

The Notebook allows you to limit the number of ingredients, which will lead to sub-optimal
but more practical recipes!

Let me know if you have suggestions for improvements. Not on the recipe but on the notebook.
