I'm not sure between this project and [optime], which was the chicken and which the egg.
Did I just need a guinea pig project to test my optimizer or did I make an optimizer for
this project?

Anyway, most probably I got a bit carried away after reading this article on Our World in Data:
[Environmental Impacts of Food Production][owid]. The article compares a number of food
products based on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, land use, water use, [eutrophication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication)
per kg but also per 100 g of protein, 100 g of fat and per 1000 kcal.

I thought it would be interesting to take this one step further and use this data to create
'recipes' that would target a certain nutritional value (in terms of kcal, grams of fat,
grams of protein) but minimize the environmental impact. This problem seemed perfect
for a genetic algorithm, et voila: [optime] was born (or, optime was laid and then I needed
something to try it out et voila, this project was born)!

Turns out, no chickens nor eggs in the most optimal recipe, but pain-au-chocolat and pumpkin seeds!
You may get different results because of the random events (something with gods and dice).

You can directly open and explore the Notebook in Google Colab here:

Or download it on GitHub [here][gh-nb].


Here's a graph of how the optimizer optimized the optimization goals:
