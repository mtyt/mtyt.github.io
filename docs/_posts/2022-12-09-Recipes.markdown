I'm not sure between this project and [optime], which was the chicken and which the egg.
Did I just need a guinea pig project to test my optimizer or did I make an optimizer for
this project?

Anyway, most probably I got a bit carried away after reading this article on Our World in Data:
[Environmental Impacts of Food Production][owid]. The article compares a number of food
products based on CO2 emissions, land use, water use, [eutrophication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication)
per kg but also per 100 g of protein, 100 g of fat and per 1000 kcal.

I thought it would be interesting to take this one step further and use this data to create
'recipes' that would target a certain nutritional value (in terms of kcal, grams of fat,
grams of protein) but minimizes the environmental impact. This problem seemed perfect
for a genetic algorithm, et voila: [optime] was born (or, optime was born and then I needed
something to try it out et voila, this project was born)!

Turns out, no chickens nor eggs in the most optimal recipe, but croissants and onions!
You may get different results because of the random events - turns out the gods do play dice.
