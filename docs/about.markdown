My name is Maarten Tytgat, born in 1986 in Leuven, Belgium and not dead yet!
I know this because I'm writing it. Should it no longer be true when you read it, well then
it's not my problem anymore.

I've studied electrical engineering at the KU Leuven and went on to do a PhD on the topic
of millimeter-wave chip design.
Then I went to work for Nokia Bell-Labs as a chip designer, first in Antwerp and then for
a year in New Jersey.
You can find some of my publications and patents from that time [here][scholar]{:target="_blank"}.

After coming back to Europe, I co-founded a chip design
company called [Tusk IC][tusk-ic]{:target="_blank"}, based in Antwerp.

After almost five years, it was time for me to explore new areas. So I left the company (in very good hands)
and started dividing most of my time between my 1-year old son and a laptop in my attic.
Now I'm doing some small programming projects that I'm publishing on this site. This way
I can keep learning, figure out what I like to do and build a portfolio.

I used to have Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and all that but then I decided to quit that stuff. 
I'm not completely freed from the big tech companies though, because I'm publishing this site and my code repositories on
[GitHub][github]{:target="_blank"} and for professional reasons, I also have a [LinkedIn profile][linkedin]{:target="_blank"}.
And of course there is my gmail address [maarten.tytgat@gmail.com](mailto:maarten.tytgat@gmail.com).
But hey, one step at a time, right! So I have [Mastodon][mastodon]{:target="_blank"} as well.

I'm also a musician altough I have to admit, a less active one than my 25-year-old self would find okay.
Anyway, some of my (old) music is on [Spotify][spotify]{:target="_blank"} and [Soundcloud][soundcloud]{:target="_blank"}.
