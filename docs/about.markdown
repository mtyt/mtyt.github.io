My name is Maarten Tytgat, born in 1986 in Leuven, Belgium and not dead yet!
I know this because I'm writing it. Should it no longer be true when you read it, it's not my
problem anymore.

I've studied electrical engineering at the KU Leuven and went on to do a PhD on the topic
of millimeter-wave chip design.
Then I went to work for Nokia Bell-Labs as a chip designer, first in Antwerp and then for
a year in New Jersey.

You can find some of my publications and patents from that time [here][scholar]{:target="_blank"}.

After coming back to Europe, I co-founded a chip design
company called [Tusk IC][tusk-ic]{:target="_blank"}, based in Antwerp.

After almost five years, it was time for me to explore new areas and so I left the company (in very good hands)
and started spending more time with my 1-year old son and a laptop in my attic to do some small
projects, which I will publish on this site.

I used to have Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and all that but then I decided to quit that stuff. 
But I'm not completely freed from the big tech companies, because I'm publishing this site and my code repositories on
[GitHub][github]{:target="_blank"} and for professional reasons, I also still have a [LinkedIn profile][linkedin]{:target="_blank"}.
And of course there is my gmail address [maarten.tytgat@gmail.com](mailto:maarten.tytgat@gmail.com).
But hey, one step at a time, right! So I have [Mastodon][mastodon]{:target="_blank"} as well.

I'm also a musician altough I have to admit, a less active one than my 25-year-old self would find okay.
Anyway, some of my (old) music is on [Spotify][spotify]{:target="_blank"} and [Soundcloud][soundcloud]{:target="_blank"}.

Futile Devices is the name of my one-man-company.
Every month, the company donates \$120 to [GiveWell][givewell]{:target="_blank"} (so I should probably find some paid work soon),
which I'm not writing here to impress anyone, but to motivate you to do the same.
