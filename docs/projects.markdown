# Optime
In a masters course project, I learned about genetic algorithms, and since then I've applied
them (using [DEAP]) for optimization of electronic circuits. Now, I decided to implement my
own Python variant, since I only needed the basics. It's probably not very efficient, but it should
be fairly easy to use.
